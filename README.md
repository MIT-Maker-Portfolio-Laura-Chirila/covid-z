# COVID-z

A web platform that helps medical staff diagnose potentially COVID-19 infected patients using Artificial Intelligence.

# Note

I used PHP in a previous version of this project to route the app and parse the JSON response from the global statistics API. 
This is why PHP is mentioned under the Technologies Used section in the document provided.
